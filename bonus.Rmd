This page contains links to journal articles, blog posts, webpages, etc., that we (the instructors) believe may be useful to you, or at the very least interesting. **Bold** articles are ones that we consider **must-reads** but don't have enough time to actually assign. And to be clear, must-read means that people will probably assume you've read this and know the basic points.  

## On data collection, measuring constructs, scales

Lord (1953) ["On the statistical treatment of football numbers."](readings/Lord_1953.pdf) -- This one is worth reading several times, ideally with a friend. Don't worry, it's quite short. A small note: "Tchebycheff" is sometimes written as "Chebyshev" and in either case is pronounced Cheb-ee-sheve. 

Malone & Goldstone (2019) ["Episode 936: The Modal American."](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/28/755191639/episode-936-the-modal-american) -- This episode of NPR's podcast, _Planet Money_, is a great discussion of what we mean when we say "average," why the mean can be a bad measure of central tendency, and how complicated calculating simple statistics are. They don't use the words "artifact" or "collinearity", but they discuss both and how they can lead to bad answers.

## On probability and its use and misuse

Fry (2019) ["What statistics can and can't tell us about ourselves"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/09/what-statistics-can-and-cant-tell-us-about-ourselves). This article in the *New Yorker* explains issues of (frequentist) probability in terms you can explain to your grandma, as well as makes clear the issues of the Fisher tradition of reducing experiments to p-values. 

## On the credibility revolution (aka replication crisis or reproducibility crisis)

**Ioannidis (2005) ["Why most published findings are false."](readings/Ioannidis_2005.pdf)** -- This is one of the articles that kick-started the concern. 

**Bem (2011) ["Feeling the future: Experimental evidence for anomalous retroactive influences on cognition and affect."](readings/Bem_2011.pdf)** -- It's true, ESP is real. Or is it? What (if anything) in this article makes you skeptical of the results? Try to articulate the weaknesses. 

Bem (2004) ["Writing the empirical journal article."](readings/Bem_2004.pdf) -- This was assigned to me when I was a graduate student. Some of the advice is actually very good, although most of the best stuff can be found in Strunk and White. The part of this article that's really worth reading is the "Analyzing Data" and "Reporting the Findings" subsections of "Planning your article."

## On coding and data science

Peters (2004) ["The Zen of Python"](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) -- A list of 19 principles for writing better Python code; the principles also apply to writing better R code.
