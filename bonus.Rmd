This page contains links to journal articles, blog posts, webpages, etc., that we (the instructors) believe may be useful to you, or at the very least interesting. **Bold** articles are ones that we consider **must-reads** but don't have enough time to actually assing. And to be clear, must-read means that people will probably assume you've read this and know the basic points.  

## On data collection, measuring constructs, scales

Lord (1953) ["On the statistical treatment of football numbers."](readings/Lord_1953.pdf) -- This one is worth reading several times, ideally with a friend. Don't worry, it's quite short. A small note: "Tchebycheff" is sometimes written as "Chebyshev" and in either case is pronounced Cheb-ee-sheve. 

## On the credibility revolution (aka replication crisis or reproducibility crisis)

**Ioannidis (2005) ["Why most published findings are false."](readings/Ioannidis_2005.pdf)** -- This is one of the articles that kick-started the concern. 

**Bem (2011) ["Feeling the future: Experimental evidence for anomalous retroactive influences on cognition and affect."](readings/Bem_2011.pdf)** -- It's true, ESP is real. Or is it? What (if anything) in this article makes you skeptical of the results? Try to articulate the weaknesses. 

Bem (2004) ["Writing the empirical journal article."](readings/Bem_2004.pdf) -- This was assigned to me when I was a graduate student. Some of the advice is actually very good, although most of the best stuff can be found in Strunk and White. The part of this article that's really worth reading is the "Analyzing Data" and "Reporting the Findings" subsections of "Planning your article."
