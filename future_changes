general lab feedback
* make the first minihack easy and walk them through it
* find out what was in the bootcamp and you can skim or gloss that content
* exercises throughout are good

1-intro.html
* Replace Leibniz picture with Helmhotlz
    * Don't bother with Locke and Leibniz
    * The cleaner story is to talk about Descartes (statue story) then to Helmholtz (measuring reaction times) then more complex data.
    *Hold back non-psych students to meet each other and form study groups
    
2-measurement.html
* Replace "units" with something else
* Remove humor nomological net -- better to use the student generated example

lab-1.html
* make it shorter -- didn't get to mini-hacks (aim for 20 min for mini-hacks each week)
  * importing data can be delayed until lab 2 (maybe?)
  * idea: keep all material in document, but skim sections (e.g., types of variables)
* next set of RAs add questions throughout (parts where students have to complete code or write answers)
  * students look at prepared markdown, but TAs live-code (print html so you know where you are)
  
3-describing_data_1.html
* too long! 
* did we use world happiness? take out description of variables
* leptokurtic - leaping up, platykurtic -- plate, mesokurtic -- middle
* is there a more efficient way to make the point about statistical tests of normality being tied to sample size?

lab-2.html
* more interactive throughout
* ask more questions (sometimes on html doc, or not)

5-matrix.html
* For XT and TX, give example in slides
* post-multiply -- affecting columns, doing this to every single row
* pre-multiply -- affecting row, doing this to every single column
* add orders to all matrix notations

quiz-2.docx
* replace word "masquerade"

lab-3.html
* notes: covered a lot of material, went slowly and left time for first mini-hack (walk through first together), linear combinations were difficult
* more relevant or straight-forward examples for diagonal matrices and pre- and post-multiplication
* give mean example

6-probability.html
* define random
* add animations!
* bag of candy -- replacement vs not

7-binomial.html
* make clear -- binary/binomial doesn't mean 50%
* any sample space can be divided into two non-elementary events
* explain a deck of cards (what?!)


1-homework.Rmd
* rewrite correlation freedom/generosity instructions: "calculate the correlation between freedom and generosity" (take out thing about "for a country")
* question 5.1 -- take out density distribution or give them code. (students are drawing based on mean and sd, not using empirical)
* 5.3 change validity of correlation to "statistical conclusion valdity"
* more time for homeworks? post 2 weeks in advance, instead of 1

8-normal.html
* move slides about chi sq from sampling to here

lab-4.html
* need to explain a deck of cards

10-nhst.html
* more on pvalues

lab-5.html
* skim tidy data and helper functions, but keep in so people can see them
