# Getting Started

[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is a highly flexible, yet intuitive, open-source programming language used for statistical computing. It is relatively new (as relatively new as one of your GEs), but it has an engaged following of data scientists and developers. Unlike other statistics programs (e.g., SPSS, SAS), [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is free. 

Only one piece of software is required to get started using [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) but there is a second piece of software that we highly recommend. The first piece of software is, confusingly, *R* or what I, less confusingly, refer to as the *R Engine*. The *R Engine* essentially allows the computer to understand the *R* programming language, turning your lines of text into computer operations. [Instructions for downloading the R Engine](#download_r) are included below.

The second, piece of software is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) is an integrated development environment (IDE). In the simplest terms, it provides a clean, organized way of interacting with the *R Engine*. [Instructions for downloading the RStudio](#download_rstudio) are included below.

## Downloading the R Engine {#download_r}

1. Navigate to the webpage for the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org) (commonly referred to as CRAN).
1. Under "Download and Install R" click the link for your operating system. I am using a Mac, so I would click [Download R for (Mac) OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
1. Click the link for the latest release. As of writing this, the newest package is `R 3.6.1. "Action of the Toes"` (all version nicknames are references to the [Peanuts comic strip](https://twitter.com/snoopy/status/976452382480531458)). I would click `R-3.6.1.pkg` to start the download.
1. Once the file is downloaded, click on it to open it. Your operating system should guide you through the rest of the installation process. 

*Note.* Perhaps unintuitively, the same steps are used to update the R Engine. You are simply replacing the old version of the R Engine with the new version.

## Downloading RStudio {#download_rstudio}
<!--1. Navigate to the webpage for [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com).
1. Click [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
1. Click the [Download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) listed under the free version. For our purposes (and, in fact, for most people's purposes) the free version is all that is needed.-->
1. Navigate to the webpage for the free version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). For our purposes (and, in fact, for most people's purposes) the free version is all that is needed. The available installers are listed at the bottom of the page under the heeader "Installers for Supported Platforms."
1. Select the installer for your operating system. Since I am using a Mac, I would click `RStudio 1.2.1335 - macOS 10.12+ (64-bit)`.
1. Once the file is downloaded, click on it to open it. Your operating system should guide you through the rest of the installation process. 

*Note.* To update [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) after it is already installed, all you have to do is navigate to `Help > Check for Updates` in the menubar. 

# Features of RStudio

As shown in the image below, an [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) session is split into four sections (also called panes): [the source pane](#rstudio_source), [the console](#rstudio_console), [the environment/history pane](#rstudio_environment), and the succinctly named [files/plots/packages/help pane](#rstudio_files).

![](`r here::here("labs", "resources", "lab1", "lab1_rstudio_4panel.jpg")` "Four Panes of RStudio")

## Source {#rstudio_source}

![](`r here::here("labs", "resources", "lab1", "lab1_rstudio_source.png")` "RStudio Source Pane")

## Console {#rstudio_console}

In RStudio, the console pane essentially shows you the R-engine. The console evaluates the code you provide it (including the code stored in [the source pane](#rstudio_source). 

![](`r here::here("labs", "resources", "lab1", "lab1_rstudio_console.png")` "RStudio Console Pane")

## Enivornment/History {#rstudio_environment}
![](`r here::here("labs", "resources", "lab1", "lab1_rstudio_environment.png")` "RStudio Environment Pane")

## Files/Plots/Packages/Help {#rstudio_files}
![](`r here::here("labs", "resources", "lab1", "lab1_rstudio_files.png")` "RStudio Files Pane")

# Variables

## Creating Variables

```{r }
my_number  <- 10
another_number <- 15
another_number  <- 5

my_string      <- "hello"
another_string <- "world"
```

# Packages and function

A package is collection of code, documentation for that code, and, potentially data. A helpful way to think of packages is as a toolbox full of tools. There are general purpose toolboxes that contain tools for running common analyses in psychology (e.g., `psych`), toolboxes for helping your run advanced statistical models (e.g., `lavaan`; `lmer`), toolboxes for text mining (e.g., `tidytext`), and toolboxes for plotting (e.g., `ggplot2`, `gganimate`). If you have a problem that needs to be solved, there will likely be a package for it. 

The tools of these toolboxes are called functions. Functions take a number of inputs (i.e., `arguments`) and returns some output (called the `values`). For example, the `corr.test` function in the `psych` package takes a dataframe and returns the correlations of all the variables in the dataset and the p-values for each of those correlations.

## Installing a package

To install a package onto your computer, you simply pass the name of the package to `install.packages()`. As a demonstration, we install the the `yarrr` package below. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("yarrr")
```

*Note.* When installing packages, the package name must be enclosed in quotes: `install.packages("yarrr")` *NOT* `install.packages(yarrr)`.

## Loading a package

Just because we've installed a package doesn't mean we have access to its functions. Returning to our analogy from above, just because we have a toolbox doesn't mean we have access to it. If it is the basement, we need to get it before we start working in the attic. To load the `yarrr` package and make its tools available to us

```{r}
library(yarrr)
```

*Note.* A package can be loaded with or without quotes: `library("yarrr")` *OR* `library(yarrr)`.
