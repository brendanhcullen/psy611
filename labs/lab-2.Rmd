# Getting Started {#gs}

So what is R? 

In the simplest possible terms, R is a programming language used for conducting analyses and producing graphics. It is substantially more flexible than GUI-based statistics programs (e.g., SPSS, LISREL) but less flexible than other programming languages. This lack of flexibility is on purpose; it allows the code to written in a far more efficient and intuitive way than other programming languages.

Only one piece of software is required to get started using the R programming language and, confusingly, it is also called R. I will refer to it here as the *R Engine*. The R Engine essentially allows the computer to understand the R programming language, turning your lines of text into computer operations. Unlike other popular statistics programs (e.g., SPSS, SAS), the R Engine is free. [Instructions for downloading the R Engine](#download_r) are below.

A second piece of software that is not required to use R but is nonetheless useful is [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) is an *integrated development environment* (IDE) or, in potentially overly simplistic terms, a tool that makes interacting with the R Engine easier. [Instructions for downloading RStudio](#download_rstudio) are also below.

## Downloading the R Engine {#download_r}

1. Navigate to the webpage for the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org) (commonly referred to as CRAN).
1. Under "Download and Install R" click the appropriate link for your operating system. I am using a Mac, so I would click [Download R for (Mac) OS X](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).
1. Click the link for the latest release. As of writing this, the newest package is `R 3.6.1. "Action of the Toes"` (all version nicknames are references to the [Peanuts comic strip](https://twitter.com/snoopy/status/976452382480531458)). I would click `R-3.6.1.pkg` to start the download.
1. Once the file is downloaded, click on it to open it. Your operating system should guide you through the rest of the installation process. 

*Note.* The same steps are used to update the R Engine: You install a new version and replace the old version in the process. 

## Downloading RStudio {#download_rstudio}
<!--1. Navigate to the webpage for [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com).
1. Click [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
1. Click the [Download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) listed under the free version. For our purposes (and, in fact, for most people's purposes) the free version is all that is needed.-->
1. Navigate to the webpage for the free version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). For our purposes (and for most people's purposes) the free version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) is all that you need. The available installers are listed at the bottom of the page under the header "Installers for Supported Platforms."
1. Select the installer for your operating system. Since I am using a Mac, I would click `RStudio 1.2.1335 - macOS 10.12+ (64-bit)`.
1. Once the file is downloaded, click on it to open it. Your operating system should guide you through the rest of the installation process. 

*Note.* To update [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) after it is already installed, all you have to do is navigate to `Help > Check for Updates` in the menubar.
