# Getting Started {#gs}

So what is R? 

In the simplest possible terms, 

![](`r here::here("labs", "resources", "lab1", "other", "lab1_flow.png")` "Flow")

Only one piece of software is

# Minihacks {#minihacks}

Now that we have covered the lab material, we will move on to the Minihacks. You are welcome to work with a partner or in a small group of 2-3 people. If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them!

## Minihack 1: R Markdown

1. Create an `R Markdown` document called `lab1_minihacks`.

## Minihack 2: Arithmetic Commands

1. Use R to solve for $x$: $$x = \frac{(102 + 68) \times (3 + 2) + 1250}{50}$$

## Minihack 3: Functions

1. Assign the string `"I AM NOT YELLING"` to a variable called `exclamation`.

## Minihack 4: Help Documentation

1. I wanted to create a vector of `5`

```{r}
seq(from = 10, to = 50, by = 5)
```

## Minihack 5: Data Frames

1. Download the [Marvel character dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n59gFMfvLXN1rUwRjFV5qf5VNp3im_bj6AgHuv7mXTs/export?format=xlsx) to your computer. 

1. Import the data into R and assign it to a variable called `marvel_data`. 

1. Ah! The value for the number of appearances of Spider-Man seems to be an error! It should be `4043` not `40430`! Use square brackets (`[]`) to replace the erroneous value with the correct value (*hint:* The value is stored in the first row of the eighth column).
