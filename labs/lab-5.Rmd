For further resources, check out [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/){target="_blank"} by Hadley Wickham and [this cheatsheet on data wrangling](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf){target="_blank"} from RStudio.


Today's lab will cover:

1. [Summarizing data](#summarize)

# **Intro to the tidyverse**{#tidy}

The tidyverse, according to its creators, is ["an opionated collection of R packages designed for data science."](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} It's a suite of packages designed with a consistent philosophy and aesthetic. This is nice because all of the packages are designed to work well together, providing a consistent framework to do many of the most common tasks in R including, but not limited to:

* data cleaning (`tidyr`)
* data manipulation (`dplyr`)
* data visualization (`ggplot2`)
* working with strings (`stringr`)
* working with factors (`forcats`)

To load all the packages included in the tidyverse, use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# if tidverse is not installed first use `install.packages("tidyverse")`
library(tidyverse)
```


Today we'll mostly focus on data manipulation with `dplyr`.

Three qualities of the `tidyverse` are worth mentioning at the outset:

1. Packages are designed to be like *grammars* for their task, so we'll be using terms like verbs to discuss the tidyverse. The idea is that you can string these grammatical elements together to form more complex statements, just like with language. 

2. The first argument of (basically) every function is `data`. This is very handy, especially when it comes to piping (discussed below).

3. Variable names are *usually* not quoted.

## What is data wrangling?

Data wrangling, broadly speaking, means getting your data into a useful form for visualizing and modelling it. Hadley Wickham, who has developed a lot of the tidyverse, conceptualizes the main steps involved in data wrangling as follows:

1. Importing your data (we covered this in [Week 1's lab](https://uopsych.github.io/psy611/labs/lab-1.html#importing_data_into_r){target="_blank"})
2. Tidying your data (see brief overview below)
3. Transforming your data (what we'll cover today)

The figure below highlights the steps in data wrangling in relation to the broader model of a typical data science workflow:

## What is tidy data?

Data is considered "tidy" when:

1. Each variable has its own column
2. Each observation has its own row
3. Each value has its own cell

The following figure from *R for Data Science* illustrates this visually.

</center>

If your data is not in tidy format already when you import it, the `tidyR` package contains functions, e.g. `gather()` and `spread()`, that allow you to "reshape" your data to get it into tidy format. 

However, this term we are mostly going to work with simpler datasets that are already tidy, so we are not going to focus on these functions today. These functions will become especially useful in the future when we work with repeated measures data that has multiple observations for each subject. If you are interested in learning more about reshaping your data with `tidyR`, check out [this chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#introduction-6){target="_blank"} from *R for Data Science*.

## Today's focus: `{dplyr}`

Most of the functions we'll go over today come from the `{dplyr}` package. Essentially, you can think of this package as a set of "pliers" that you can use to tweak data frames, hence its name (and hex sticker).

## Pipes

Pipes come from the magrittr library are available when you load the tidyverse. (The pipe is technically imported with `{dplyr}`.) Pipes are a way to write strings of functions more easily, creating *pipelines*. They are extremely powerful and useful. A pipe looks like this:

`%>%`

You can enter a pipe with the shortcut `CTRL+Shift+M` for PC or `CMD+Shift+M` for Mac.

Technically, a pipe passes an object on the left-hand side as the first argument (or `.` argument) of whatever function is on the right-hand side.

* `x %>% f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`

* `y %>% f(x, ., z)` is the same as `f(x, y, z )`

For example, to calculate the mean of the `mpg` variable from the `mtcars` dataset and round our answer to 2 decimal places, we can do the following...

```{r}
mtcars$mpg %>% 
  mean(na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  round(2)
```

This is the same as what we were doing before...

```{r}
round(mean(mtcars$mpg, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
```

## Example dataset

Because you are already familiar with the World Happiness dataset, we will use this as a running example today. You can import the data with the following code:

```{r}
world_happiness <- rio::import("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uopsych/psy611/master/labs/resources/lab5/data/world_happiness_2015_sim.csv")
```
