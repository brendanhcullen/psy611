# Purpose

The purpose of today's lab is to walk through how to create a pre-registration on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io){target="_blank"}. Rather than serve as a step-by-step tutorial, this page will mostly contain links to other resources on pre-registration and open science that you can use when drafting your own preregistrations, along with a few questions/prompts to guide our discussion. 

*Note:* A lot of the material in this document has been copied (or adapted) from pregistration workshops by Moin Syed (https://osf.io/pm8bh/) and Cassie Brandes (https://osf.io/pm8bh/).
