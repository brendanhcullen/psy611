# Purpose

Today's lab will guide you through the process of conducting a paired samples *t*-test. As we did with one-sample and independent samples *t*-tests [last week](https://uopsych.github.io/psy611/labs/lab-8.html#purpose){target="_blank"}, we will compare functions from the `{stats}` and `{lsr}` packages, and we will go over how to plot paired-samples data using `{ggpubr}`.

At the end of today's lab, you will apply what you learned to a new data set in the [minihacks](#minihacks).
